## Course Description
The course provides an in depth discussion forum for the current research and possibilities to answer long-standing and emerging questions in evolution and ecology using genomic techniques. The course will discuss research articles and reviews with a genomic perspective related to: Population and Conservation Biology; Natural Selection and Adaptation, Functional Genomics; Mendelian and Quantitative Trait Evolution; Epigenetics and Phenotypic Plasticity, Symbiosis, Hybridization; Phylogenomics and Molecular Evolution; Community Ecology and Metabarcoding; Speciation and Adaptive Radiations. The genomic revolution, has not only facilitated to answer old standing questions in ecology and evolution, but has also opened the possibility of new research areas. We will examine how genomic tools that are emerging and changing rapidly are transforming biology. 


## Learning Objective
The goal is to recognize the diverse possibilities that genomic tools allow to answer evolutionary and ecological questions. Together we will enrich our conceptual understanding of genomics and the types of analysis that can be performed with genome scale data. At the end of the course participants will be able to design robust experiments to tackle their own questions and provide a detailed map of the methodological steps needed to carry out a robust study using genomic tools. 


## General course organization
The first three weeks of the course will consist of lectures reviewing major aspects of genomics, population genetics and functional genomics. We will then embark in a rich discussion of different disciplines of biology that use genomic tools. We will discuss at least two articles per meeting. Two participants will lead each discussion and everyone has to be fully prepared to discuss articles in detail and submit a 500-word summary of the topic for that week. It is the responsibility of the leaders to maintain a fluid conversation and bring new aspects into the discussion. The leaders will have to prepare a two-page summary of the discussion. I will lead the first two discussions. 

After eight weeks, and once students acquire some understanding of the possibilities to answer ecological and evolutionary questions with genomic tools, participants will write a research proposal that will be evaluated by their peers in review panels.  Reviewers and panelists will provide detailed criticisms to authors and authors will have two weeks to address criticism and resubmit their proposals. Participants are evaluated both on the originality and effort to develop their own proposals as well as their detailed criticisms when acting as reviewers and or panelists.

## Grading

In accordance with the LSU grading policy, grades will be assigned using an A-F scale and the +/- system.  Grading is pretty simple:

Item                                               | # of assignments  | % of grade
--------| -------------   | ----------------
[Class participation ](#class-participation)          | 28                   | 20%
[Per class summaries] (#Per-class-summaries)                       | 6                    | 30%
[Research proposal]  (#Research-proposal)                        | 1                | 50%
Total                                           |                     | 100%

# Class participation
(20% of grade). To earn this portion of the grade students must actively contribute to all class discussions.

# Per class summaries
(30%). Before each week’s discussion, participants will have to submit a 500-word summary of the topic being assigned for that day. Each participant has to submit at least six summaries (5% each). The participant chooses which topics to submit summaries for. It is expected that given feedback by the instructor students improve their written summaries overtime.

# Research proposal
(50% of grade). This will involve writing a four-page proposal (excluding references) that seeks to answer an ecological or evolutionary question with genomic tools. Writing the proposal itself and addressing the panel and reviewer’s comments accounts for 30% of the grade. Providing detailed criticism of the proposals when reviewers or fully engaging in discussions during panels and writing panel summaries accounts for 20% of the grade.
