The overall structure of our discussion was to first outline the key ideas and major questions the group had about the papers and then dive into more targeted questions about the papers individually and in combination with each other. We began with **Ghalambor et al. (2015)**, where the authors tested to what degree plasticity was adaptive or non-adaptive using an experiment with transplanted guppies in a natural system experiencing varying amounts of predation. The group questioned the definition of what non-adaptive plasticity entailed, which by the author’s definition included any population whose expressed phenotype was past the local optimum. While fitness and survivorship are good metrics to determine whether or not a phenotype was adaptive, there was still debate over whether it was possible to only have one local optimum, especially in a heterogeneous landscape such as the one studied in Ghalambor et al. (2015). The local optimum of a trait, we decided, usually can be depicted as the peak in a normal distribution that changes in direction and shape towards a more adaptive one (in response to a disturbance or change). It was brought up that in this study system, the guppies’ differential expression patterns were likely due to color variation, with more conspicuously-colored guppies having higher reproductive success and a higher risk of being predated upon. The group concluded that determining the non-adaptive and adaptive nature of phenotypes and phenotypic plasticity was challenging, especially as it relates to an equally vague local optimum that may change between contexts.
Then, we began talking about **Ryu et al. (2018)** and **Liew et al. (2018)** together, since both worked on determining the epigenetic mechanisms behind organisms’ phenotypic responses under environmental stress. Ryu et al. (2018) was an extension of last week’s discussion paper, Bernal et al. (2018), in which they utilize transgenerational experimental design to look at how the changes in the epigenome could contribute to transgenerational thermal plasticity between parents and offspring. Liew et al. (2018) on the other hand, examined methylation patterns in a coral species undergoing different pH conditions and found that while there were no differential expression patterns in biomineralization pathways, there was a general lowering of transcriptional noise with an increase in methylation. One of the first things we discussed was the various ways in which to visualize differential expression patterns, including the utility of heatmaps when looking at fine-scale patterns between treatment groups. One suggestion that was brought up to better visualize a direction response was a comparative bar chart with certain genes of interest. We ultimately could not think of a better way to qualitatively display all of the data and contrasted the aesthetics and utility of the figures used in the two papers. We agreed that the figures in Ryu et al. (2018) were easier to understand and told a better story, in contrast to Liew et al. (2018), who in Figure 2, showed the same conclusion in multiple ways. With regards to the flow of the two papers, it was also brought up that Liew et al. (2018) did not tell a coherent story because they sequenced the epigenome first, then conducted measurements and experiments on the phenotypic response to associate the two, rather than the other way around.

To answer the questions posed to the class, students paired off to discuss their thoughts in groups of two or three before sharing with the rest of the class. We talked about the following:

* *Is it adaptive or non-adaptive for corals to maintain their extension rate at the expense of increased porosity?*
  * On one hand, maintaining extension rates could help with competition for space and sunlight on a reef, but could mean increased fragmentation if they are too fragile. Increased sexual/asexual reproduction (e.g. fragmentation) could also be considered adaptive, though one has to consider the survivorship of those more fragile fragments.
* *If CpG’s, CHG’s, and CHH’s are all implicated in transgenerational plasticity, then why weren’t they all analyzed?*
  * Even though CpG islands are more involved in transcription, CHH’s are also implicated in epigenetic mechanisms. In the scope of Ryu et al. (2018), they likely excluded CHH analysis because it would have added too much noise to their overall goal of detecting any sort of epigenetic mechanism. In addition, methylation is not the only epigenetic mechanism - there is also histone modification, which may affect the expression of certain phenotypes.
* *Can we compare the epigenetics of an invertebrate to those of a vertebrate?*
  * DNA methylation patterns occur differently in vertebrate and invertebrate systems, making it difficult to directly compare the two systems. In vertebrates, DNA methylation typically occurs on CpG islands, which are usually situated on promoter regions of the DNA and regulate transcription. As discussed in [Roberts and Gavery, 2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22232607), DNA methylation in invertebrates can have sparse methylation patterns that can result in: alternative start sites, sequence mutation, exon skipping, and transient methylation. This additionally explains some of the epigenome-transcriptome variations between the two studies.
