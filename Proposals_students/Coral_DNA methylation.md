## DNA Methylation in Corals
Principal Investigator: Wong, Kevin

### Reviewer 1

*What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?*

This project focuses on the role of epigenetics, specifically DNA methylation, on the ability of stony corals to rapidly acclimatize to thermal stress. The researchers are examining both within generational plasticity (WGP), and trans generational plasticity (TGP). The goals of the project were specific, focused, and well-stated throughout the proposal. This is a transgenerational study, and therefore allows the researchers to draw new conclusions about the possible future of coral acclimatization to climate change.

The researchers did a good job outlining the new questions they will be answering, especially the epigenetic relationships that have been understudied in scleractinian corals. And while their questions are new, their methods for examining DNA methylation are well understood (although additional support for the efficacy of those methods could be helpful). The researchers had clear plans for their research, and seemed to have sufficient background in the field of study to perform their experiments well. The graphic explaining the experimental design of Aim 2 was especially effective, and demonstrated how they are doing a true transgenerational study.

One possible gap in the proposal was a lack of background information about the two different coral species being studied. While Astrangia poculata and Porites astreoides are both stony corals, they are in two different families and are being studied in two very different environments. Also, the A. poculata research takes place entirely in closed, experimental systems, while the P. astreoides experiments are partially in the field. It was unclear if these differences would have a significant effect on the application of the results. Since the results from both halves of the project are being used together to form larger conclusions, a discussion of why this valid would be helpful. It is true that both species will be exposed to similar stressors, so that remains consistent. It may be that these differences are not a problem, but it wasn’t addressed in the proposal.


*What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?*

The researchers have a clear plan to make their data widely available, and their analysis reproducible. They exhibit a familiarity with bioinformatics and in communicating their findings. This is important as their methods could be more widely applied to other stony coral species.

There are also many opportunities for outreach and education as part of this project. The researchers are familiar with the BIOS research station, and have previous experience with the internship program there. The program will involve local Bermudians in research and education. At URI, the researchers will collaborate with the Society for Women in Marine Science (SWMS) on some of their outreach and education programs. While there were specific activities proposed their time at BIOS (such as the camp run through the SPCA), there were fewer concrete ideas for their time at URI. However, since they are collaborating with an already established group, there will hopefully be multiple opportunities for outreach.

A major strength is that their outreach and collaborations will reach both the local community, and groups underrepresented in STEM fields.

This project also focuses on the effects of climate change, which is a major issue impacting many species other than corals. There is a clear application of the methods to other systems, and a clear application to global conservation efforts.


*Summary Statement*

Overall, this was a strong proposal, and the researchers seem well prepared to carry out the project. There are clear implications for both research and conservation, and are asking new questions about an important ecosystem. This project has sufficient support, planning, and advances the field. I recommend funding.



### Reviewer 2
Rating: Very Good

This proposal aims to determine the relationship between metabolic function and epigenomic patterning and explain how they interact to help shape trans-generational plasticity. Two experiments, using two different coral species from different North Atlantic localities, are clearly stated and are well thought out. For the first aim, it is clear what the author hypothesizes and that the proposed treatments will determine how nutrition might drive patterns in physiological measures that correspond to a hypothesized TGP pathway. While the metabolic traits to be measured make sense, it’s a little unclear whether bulk potential or site-specific changes in methylation would better test this hypothesis. The second aim in this regard is clearer, noting particular transcriptomic and epigenomic methods to be used.

One possible issue with this proposal is that the knowledge gap that would prompt such well-designed experimental work is not exactly clear. The plausibility of the proposed work is laid out effectively in the background section, where a strong case is made that metabolic activity and nutrition availability have the potential to influence epigenetic markers and phenotype plasticity more broadly. But the extent to which these connections have been researched previously and the expected relative importance of this putative pathway to changes in plasticity are unclear. These omissions make an evaluation of the novelty and impact of this research difficult.

After reading this proposal, I have several questions about the justification or rationale for the use of each study system. Are these coral species closely related? Are they representative of broader coral communities (particularly the temperate collections Astrangia poculata)? Given that each experiment uses a different species, how will findings from each aim support each other to further understanding of nutritional impacts on methylation? And finally, what is the current availability of transcriptomic and epigenomic resources available to support your analyses? For example, if they are not robust, does your proposed analysis support de novo assessment? If this is irrelevant, that was hard to determine in the proposal itself.
I believe the proposed research topic and specific aims are interesting and well-considered. The rationale for the research is clear, but its novelty is not explicitly stated. I would accept this proposal pending elaboration on its novelty and the study systems they propose to use, as explained above.


### Reviewer 3

*What is the intellectual merit of the proposed study?*

The goals of the proposal are to combine metabolomic and epigenomic approaches to elucidate the potential for acclimatization of corals to impending stressors, such as increased temperature.

The big strength of this proposed study is the emphasis on the interconnection of processes within an organism, understanding why a phenomenon like DNA methylation happens is to understand the metabolic background that allows it to happen. Additionally, the role of nutrition feeding into the metabolic processes is an important area to study. Importantly, this study proposes to address the next steps in understanding coral physiology and phenotypic trajectory as reefs continue to decline world-wide.

The interactions of enzymes, substrates, metabolites, and other molecules inside a cell that are necessary for DNA methylation need to be considered as complementary to studies that are focused on epigenetic differences. Following the chain back through the SAM cycle, other enzymes, and potentially molecules like folate, can really help elucidate why or how DNA methylation is happening. Methylation patterns in turn alter phenotypes, which may or may not lead to acclimatization.

It would be interesting to look at how DNA methylation may or may not affect the genes underlying the metabolic processes outlined on this proposal, such as components for the electron transport chain, the S-adenosylmethionine cycle, and the methionine cycle. In theory there could be a positive or negative feedback loop within that process.

While the two proposed experiments center around some of the same metabolic pathways and questions, how or if the results of one could potentially inform each other or be combined into a broader context is not stated in the proposal. If this is a limitation of using two different species, or measuring other differing metrics, is not clear. Additional information about when gametogenesis occurs in Porites astreoides is needed to understand the choice of the timing for the first temperature treatment.

The complexity of the transgenerational experiment is both exciting and daunting. It will be a challenge to tease out effects from parental fed/not fed treatment to larval effects of feeding, and with the added layer of temperature stress. There is the potential for not being able to find a causative effect because of all of the variables. However, multi-pronged approaches are necessary to understand phenomena such as temperature stress, because corals who experience high temperatures may also be limited or not on food, which would clearly affect their outcome from the stress event.

*What are the broader impacts of the proposed study?*

The author of the proposal sites their formative time leading a Bermuda summer camp focused on ocean studies. I think it is very important to engage with the local community where one is doing any field work, especially over-seas. The ability for a foreign researcher to use the ecosystem of another place is a great privilege, and so anything one can do to give back to the community is incredibly important. And I agree with the author, education at a young age fosters a lifetime of appreciation for natural resources and ecosystems.

Additionally, the commitment to providing all data in a reproducible fashion is something that should be necessary for all research, which the author does intend to do.

*Summary Statement*

There is a dire need to understand the mechanisms for coral reef acclimatization to climate change conditions. To keep an optimistic outlook, we must consider acclimatization as a short-term approach for corals to survive, and then investigate further to see if transgenerational affects may play a role.

The understanding of mechanisms behind plasticity in phenotypes and corals that survive bleaching or other stress event can help connect them back into their broader environment. Unfortunately, we know that temperature warming, caused by CO2 emissions is what is most effecting corals. But that is not something local governments or conservation groups can have much of an impact on. If a connection between coral acclimatization and nutrients or nutrition can be made, there is more potential for local management to still have a measurable positive effect on the coral community.

Overall this study proposed strong questions, and attempts to answer them in well thought-out, if complex, ways.
