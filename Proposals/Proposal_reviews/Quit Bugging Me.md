## Quit Bugging Me! The Invasive Asian Reed Scale, Nipponclerda biwakoensis, attacks stressed Roseau Cane on the Gulf Coast, USA
Author: Jennifer Soukup


### Reviewer 1

*What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?*

The proposed work aims to evaluate the effects of an invasive insect, Reed Scale, on a native plant species, Roseau Cane. Specifically, how the presence of the Reed Scale impacts the Roseau Cane’s ability to tolerate abiotic stressors and if that tolerance is affected by lineage. The projects would expand on current collaborations in Louisiana that focus on understanding the negative impacts of this recently introduced insect and a destructive environmental phenomenon called reed die-back. The author hypothesizes that the invasive insect is affecting the sugar concentrations in the Roseau Cane that are needed for osmoregulation. Because of this, the Roseau Cane may not be able to tolerate stressors like salinity changes and increase in eutrophication. Both reed die-back and this invasive insect are new to the Mississippi River Delta and the potential negative impacts are not well described.

*What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?*

Not clearly stated. There is a section about how the study will benefit coastal wetlands and a section on plans to share with a larger audience. The proposal would be stronger if these sections were combined and stated at the beginning of the proposal with a strong summary of what the project is about.

*Summary Statement*

This proposal has the potential to be a strong study but is lacking a strong broader impacts section and clearly stating novelty of the experiment. The proposal would be stronger if the author used all five pages and expanded on the genetic aspect of experiment in both the background information and experimental design sections. The first page of the proposal should give a concise summary of the experiment, intellectual merit, and broader impacts of the project. Aims and questions could be combined to have strong and clear goals for the experiment. I would challenge the author to expand on this project to include two or three projects that fulfill bigger gaps in knowledge within this field, specifically concerning reed dieback and the invasive species. The written proposal would be stronger if each section was thoroughly checked for grammar errors and clear sentence structure before submission. More citations are needed to back up claims made in all sections. This will also prove the author has a solid grasp of the current/past work in the field they’re in. The author could use an ecosystem management approach to leverage broader impacts and further application to conservation research since the background information introduces stress tolerance and anthropogenic effects.

*What is the intellectual merit of the proposed study?*

This proposal aims to access whether there are genetic groupings in the Roseau cane that are correlated with variation in starch reserves and soluble sugars, or if those important physiological metrics are more environmentally induced instead of genetically. There is also the important factor of the invasive reed scale, and the author proposes to investigate the environmental conditions that promote higher scale densities.

The relatively new invasion of the reed scale is both concerning for wetland ecosystems in the Gulf Coast of the US, as well as provides an opportunity to study individuals and populations of Roseau cane that have yet to be affected by the insect. However, it is unclear if there is any current management that aims to attenuate the spread of the reed scale. And, assuming that such efforts exist, if they would have an impact on the proposed study. Yet, it is clear that wetlands provide many ecosystem services, and especially the cane plants who are a necessary part of the system that protects the coastline from erosion. The need to investigate threats to their survival or losses of biodiversity of the species is clear.

A strength of the proposed study is the detailed look at the sugar storage and osmoregulation in the Roseau cane and how those very essential processes might be affected by the reed scale. Additionally, those processes are important in modulating survival after during and after stress events, which will likely only increase with climate change. It is becoming more common in the scientific literature to see studies that look at the potentially synergistic effects of multiple stressors. This study aims to investigate how the reed scale effects soluble sugars in the Roseau cane, which are very important in the stress response of the cane to other environmental factors. There is the potential for the scale plus other stressor such as: low salinity, eutrophication, or flood to have either additive or multiplicative negative effects on the Roseau cane. The complexity of the introduced Roseau cane group from England was not as clearly stated as it should be, and it is not clear if determining the effects of the reed scale will be only on the native cane or all populations.

Without knowing much about the extent of the reed scale, it would be interesting to know first how different genetic groups or haplotypes of the Roseau cane respond to stressors in absence of the reed scale. Or potentially there could be continuous monitoring of populations, to see if there are genetic groupings that are highly resilient to stressors, but then fair differently after infection with the reed scale.

*What are the broader impacts of the proposed study?*

I think that the note to work with the URI communications office to create a press release on the topic is an interesting and very smart idea. This could be taken a few steps further, especially visually, as I found the image of the invasive reed scale as both striking, and easy to understand. Even though there are complexities to this study and the overall ecosystem, topics such as energy availability, stress, and invasive insects are easy topics to convey to the public in a meaningful way.

*Summary Statement*

This proposal has solid intellectual merit and was well laid out. Although not specifically asked for, the breakdowns of field collection, sample analysis, and cost of the proposed study were very helpful and provided a cleared overall picture of the actual work that will be done for this project. There is a window of opportunity to study the invasion front of the reed scale on local populations of Roseau cane, and the author is well poised to do just that. The additional interaction of the reed scale and the other invasive in this system, the European cane genotype, adds complexity to the proposed study, but also provides an opportunity to study a unique situation in the theory of invasion biology. Although the invasive genotype is a clear threat to the valuable biodiversity of native US wetlands, if they can survive the reed scale better, they still may be able to save the ecosystem service that the native Roseau cane provides.

*What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?*

Roseau cane is a coastal native weed that is important for storm buffering, erosional control, water quality maintenance, and wildlife habitat in the Gulf of Mexico. The plant is currently able to persist in the presence of multiple stressors by releasing soluble sugars in order to osmoregulate. However, a recent invasion by an herbivorous scale worm may decrease the plant’s resistance to stress by depleting the plant’s starch reserves. The proposed research seeks to quantify the effects of the scale worm on reed resistance as well as determine any relationship between infestation and reed lineage.

In view of the fact that the reed scale is a recent invasive in the United States, the work proposed will provide necessary knowledge on the effects of the colonist on native plants. In my view, this information is critical to obtain; developing an understanding of how invasive species impact their new habitat is the first step in understanding how to manage invasions and restore the native phragmites. It is especially important to determine if there is any preferential herbivory on the native plant compared to the European genotype as this can exacerbate the invasion of the European phragmites species. While the invasive genotype may provide erosional control similar to Roseau cane, it has the tendency to act as an ecosystem engineer by altering nutrient cycles and grows in dense monocultures that reduce biodiversity. The potential of the proposed study to shed light on this predator-prey-competitor interaction will be highly beneficial for ecosystem managers in the United States who are working restore the native reed, especially given that the reed scale is a relatively new invasive in the region; there is little information about its ecological effect in its extended range.

The plan for carrying out the proposed research is well thought-out and much of it is already underway. That some of the work necessary for the study has already begun and there is an established timeline for data collection and field work is also promising. The proposed methodology is clear and well-reasoned; I like that the allocation of funding is transparent in the application. I am confident in the ability of this researcher to conduct this study as part of the Meyerson lab, a lab that is well-known for studying the invasion of the European phragmites globally.


*What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?*

The applicant promises to publish results in a peer review journal, give presentations on the research and share results with other phragmites research groups, and produce press releases about the research. The applicant is also planning on working with undergraduates at their institution and sharing results with undergraduate and graduate classes at their institution. While all of this is important, I think that it is also important to get the broader public more aware of the research and of the importance of reeds in general by perhaps leading salt marsh “tours” and giving public presentations.


*Summary Statement*

The proposed research promises to expand the field of invasion biology by studying the ecological interactions between competitive native and invasive reeds and their common invasive herbivore. The methodology is clear, and the applicant seems well-qualified to conduct this research as part of the URI Meyerson Lab. With the addition of broader impacts initiatives that will increase environmental mindfulness of the importance of salt marshes and of the Roseau reed I fully support this research proposal.
