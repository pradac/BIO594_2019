*Intellectual Merit*

The project aims to see the time-frame over which coral fragments become acclimated and/or less vulnerable to fish predators, as well as the changes in chemical compounds and microbial diversity that occur between these three treatments. The PI will use a variety of metabarcoding, metabolomics, and other well-established lab and field protocols to enumerate the microbial and chemical cues of coral acclimation. At the end of the study, we will have a better understanding of how coral transplanting works in response to/in tandem with natural predation.

Some concerns I have are that 1) the PI did not address how they would determine/measure whether a coral was acclimated or not (Aim 1) and 2) ideas from the introduction seem to contradict what the PI is trying to propose. For example, the PI cites in the introduction that shifts in the microbiome for fragments could make the coral more susceptible to pathogens, but later hypothesizes that shifts in the microbiome ultimately help the survival of that coral. The linkage between the presence of predators and chemical cues seems weak, as there was little information on the role of chemical cues for the coral and fish. In addition, if the biggest threat to transplanted corals is predation, as the PI cites, there is little reason to believe that the fish are being deterred somehow by a biochemical cue emanating from the coral. The timescale (2 months) of the proposed project would not address more long-term predation patterns, which would have larger implications for coral transplant success.

Despite these concerns, I think it would be interesting to examine the factors affecting coral predation (assuming its non-random) using metabolomics. The PI has a good experimental design to see if there is a preference of the predator for the same coral species, and once there is an established measurement for “acclimation,” the project would be able to determine predation behaviors of parrotfish. I recommend that the PI more explicitly incorporates the previous data on the previously-established study sites identified to see if there is a preference for a particular coral transplant species (branching or mounding?) to see if that is an effect. If it is the case that parrotfish are more likely to predate upon branching coral species, it might be beneficial to have the same experimental design for a branching coral species and mix both branching and mounding morphologies in the same experimental plot for a multi-coral species comparison.


*Broader impacts*

This project would provide undergraduate and graduate training in the lab and field, as well as curriculum for future coursework in the Florida Keys. I would recommend making those educational resources available online so other educators, perhaps in landlocked regions of the US, could have access to real-world examples of marine conservation efforts. The PI clearly has a lot of personal experience working with her collaborating institutions. She has already taken steps to establish relationships both at URI and Mote to make the mentorship and outreach possible.

*Summary*

I rate this project as Very Good because despite the conceptual/methodological concerns I have, I believe the PI is well-positioned to lead this project and the broader impacts/outreach initiatives. The framing of the project centers the study of the coral species, though I think equal effort should be placed on the predation behavior of parrotfish, as they are a key component to this interaction. Further justification of the study species (mounding vs. branching coral) and literature review regarding the success of microbiome shifts in transplanted corals would help clarify whether or not these shifts were overwhelmingly beneficial or harmful. Determining when a coral is deemed “acclimated” will be a key component to the project that needs to be addressed. Overall, I think the severity of coral bleaching requires a careful examination of successful interventions for conservation.

*What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?*

This proposal aims to determine the microbial dynamics and chemical composition of micro-fragmented Orbicella faveolata corals that are out-planted at different times. Additionally, the PI proposes that longer acclimation periods in cages reduces the amount of parrotfish predation. The PI postulates that the acclimation period in cages provides ample time to for newly fragmented and transplanted corals to change their microbial and chemical composition to be un-palatable to parrotfish. By using an experimental design of transplanting corals with various caged acclimation timepoints, their three aims include: 1) quantifying the amount of parrotfish predation, 2) the change in chemical profiles, and 3) microbial composition of the transplanted corals after 3 months.

The overall outcomes of this project seem promising, as we do need to develop robust methodology to justify the micro-fragmentation and transplantation for corals to facilitate restoration initiatives. However, this proposal is missing some key links that bring the objectives of this study together. The PI needs to bring in additional information on the chemical and microbial composition of corals under different transplant conditions and how this can potentially relate to decreased predation. There has been previous studies focusing on coral microbiome alterations under transplantation that the PI could reference to. Additionally, this proposal lacks the hypotheses and expected outcomes, which need to be showcased to provide justification for this experiment. For example, the pathways between alterations in microbial composition that leads to metabolite/chemical composition needs to be outlined. Also, the metabolites that deter predation should be mentioned, as there has been previous research on this. The experimental design is good, however a figure visually showing the experimental design and sampling timepoints would be more beneficial than the figures in the introduction.

*What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?*

The broader impacts of this study include mentoring undergraduate students from the Society for Women in Marine Science at the University of Rhode Island. Additionally, this experiment will be taken place at the Mote Marine Laboratory in the Florida Keys, which can facilitate public engagement through tours and internships.

*Summary Statement*
In all, the motivation behind this proposal is important, however further linkages between the aims need to be outlined to provide a clear justification for this study. The PI needs to incorporate more peer-reviewed literature to emphasize the importance of the coral microbiome in physiology and to prevent predation. The overall pathways linking the microbiome to chemical deterrents that prevent specifically parrotfish predation need to be elucidated.

Rating: Good

The proposed research seeks to address how acclimation duration, differences in fragment chemical signaling and differences in microbiome composition all help shape fragment transplantation survival in stony reef-building corals like O. faveolata. The authors make a good case that fish predation is a critical impediment to successful fragment transplantation, and that little is known about its specifics. To that end, the proposed first aim seems necessary to help establish common protocols for transplantation that decrease mortality, improving the efficiency of such efforts. Additionally, the proposed research targets a well-considered study system, both because of O. faveolata’s particularly relevant ecological niche as a boulder forming coral, but also because the proposed work is a collaboration amongst labs and research facilities that know this species and transplantation work in the Florida Keys Reef Tract well.

One considerable drawback of this proposal is its lack of synthesis across aims. While each of the three research aims presented are clearly related, it is unclear how the author intends to analyze the combined results of each aim. For example, is it hypothesized that coral gardening conditions are restricting important chemical profiles from forming until transplantation because particular microbial communities are not forming during this “gardening” process? Does the PI expect rapid or steady microbiome change? Are there particular chemical signals that have been previous tied to predation stress? Explicit hypotheses for each aim as well for the combined effort would go far to drive home the importance of the proposed work.

A few more comments regarding experimental design. First, as it is written, it is unclear which entity, the host or the microbiome, is expected to produce the chemical profiles the PI seeks to characterize. Second, Aim 1 states that unacclimated and acclimated corals will be transplanted as a mixed population. It may be helpful to include exactly what this means (this takes up more space but other details such as preservation fixative could be removed). Without prior knowledge of transplant spatial density or connectivity of microbiomes across a reef’s coral individuals, I might expect that mixing treatment groups could confound efforts to examine differences in microbiome composition and chemical profiles.

Overall, the proposed research is interesting and clearly needed to support coral reef conservation efforts. However, as it is currently proposed, this reviewer is left with several concerns regarding methodology and rationale of the particular experimental aims. Once the above is addressed, I believe this work should be funded.
