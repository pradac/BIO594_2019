## Marine Biofilm Ecology: Inferring habitat quality in artificial and natural marine ecosystems
Principal Investigator: Elaine Shen

###Panel Summary
###### *Overview*

This proposal aimed to study the effect of manmade and natural surfaces on the establishment of marine biofilms communities on coral reefs. The first aim was to compare biofilm composition over time on different substrates. The second aim sought to characterize the functional and metabolic properties of these biofilms and how they affect the future settlement of sessile marine invertebrates.

###### *Intellectual merit*

*Strengths*

This proposal addressed the unknown suitability of manmade surfaces use for artificial reefs in a novel way. There is a well thought-out experimental design that helps explain how the PI will answer each of her aims, both from a spatiotemporal scale and a functional perspective. There is a clear connection between the biological problem under study and its potential for reef restoration efforts. The PI plans to integrate a breadth of approaches that range from classical community ecology to the use of microbial metabarcoding to environmental DNA.

*Weaknesses*

Although a great emphasis was placed on collecting all biological information possible, environmental data was left out. Monitoring basic non-biological parameters during the experiment could contribute to make sense of ecological succession on reefs. It was not clear why there is an intense sampling effort during the first stages of the experiment but then it decreases just to few samples over the second year. Additionally, as stated by the PI, the use of replicates for each substrate is not clear. Lastly, the inclusion of a figure or graph would have been helpful for the reader.

###### *Broader Impacts*

*Strengths*

The PI clearly plans to include and involve underrepresented minorities in different aspect of the research. The project also has a strong mentoring plan for undergraduate students to foster scientific education and reproducible science. 

*Weaknesses*

The main weaknesses were a lack of outreach activities that aimed at involving the non-scientific community. Also, the proposal did not state a well-defined strategy to effectively involve underrepresented minorities in the project. 

###### *Summary*

All panelist agreed this was a strong proposal with clear aims and an innovative approach to study ecological succession on manmade structures on coral reefs.

### Reviewer 1

*What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?*

This project focuses on analyzing how marine biofilms on different substrates can be used to predict both habitat quality and possible future colonization by sessile marine invertebrates. The project specifically focuses on differences between natural and artificial environments, and assesses the effectiveness of artificial reefs. Researchers will also try to determine if artificial reefs function as sources or sinks for marine invertebrate populations.

The proposed work will take place in the Florida Keys, using already established artificial reef systems. They will compare biofilm samples to eDNA samples collected from the same area. Microbial communities will be analyzed and compared using PhyloChip-based 16S rDNA profiling and various beta diversity indices. Researchers will also take photos of the natural and artificial sites, which will be used to assess macroinvertebrate colonization over time. Later, the DNA extracts will be analyzed to determine biofilm function and metabolism. Researchers will use qualitative liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry metaproteome analyses and metatranscriptomic analyses to identify complex processes and functional structuring. Next, they will use standardized habitat assessment scores (HAS) to assess the habitats depicted in their photos, and use Personâ€™s correlations to relate biofilm diversity and function. At the end of the study, researchers hope to have identified key groups of biofilm microbes that may have important impacts on community structure and settlement.

The main strength of this proposal is that it identifies a clear knowledge gap. Biofilms are extremely important to the settlement patterns of other organisms, but few (if any) comprehensive studies have been done examining their communities. This is the first project to examine the biofilms on artificial reefs using in-situ whole-community sampling. Researchers will be able to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of artificial reefs in habitat restoration. The methods explored in this project will also be applicable to future studies.

There is a lot of potential for future research with this project. Conclusions about the relationships between biofilm diversity and settlement rely largely on correlation. The methods proposed in Aim 2 do not show true causal relationships between biofilm diversity and structure. Including gene expression analysis in this study would possibly solve this problem.


*What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?*

This project is far-reaching and incorporates a variety of different scientific methods, and therefore has many opportunities to include underrepresented minorities. The PI clearly has a strong commitment to mentoring undergraduate students, and teaching good scientific practices. However, while a commitment to increasing diversity is clear, it would be helpful for the researchers to elaborate and more fully explain specific support networks for underrepresented students. In addition, Skype A Scientist was the only specific outreach program mentioned. With a project that encompasses so many different scientific methods, researchers should also be taking advantage of many opportunities for outreach.

*Summary Statement*

This was a strong proposal. The researchers are asking novel questions, and have a clear plan of action. The proposal itself was clear and easy to follow. The results of the research will both advance -omics methods, but also provide insight for conservation practices. While the experimental design does not necessarily allow for truly conclusive results, the project is filling a knowledge gap and setting the stage for future studies. I would recommend funding.

*What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?*

This proposal aims to describe how marine biofilms on artificial and natural substrates can influence marine invertebrate recruitment in the Florida Keys. The main aims of this proposal are: 1) to determine if there are any differences in biofilm composition between artificial and natural reef substrates, and 2) to determine if marine biofilms are indicators of habitat quality (i.e. recruitment potential). The PI provides a well thought out and detailed experimental design to answer these two overarching aims. To address aim 1, the PI proposes to monitor the biofilms on various artificial reef substrates in the Florida Keys. By using Next Generation Sequencing and metabarcoding techniques, the PI will identify the composition of the biofilms and then compare this to invertebrate settlement composition using coral point count software. To address aim 2, the PI will use metabarcoding on the biofilms and compare this composition to the surrounding water with an eDNA approach. This research is fundamental to gain a further understanding of how artificial reefs will serve as a source or sink for benthic invertebrates.

*What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?*

The broader impacts of this study are to incorporate underrepresented minority students through reproducible data set generated in the project. The PI proposes to teach these students fundamental research, data analysis, and professional skills to facilitate their development as an aspiring scientist. Additionally, the PI will be involved with the Skype a Scientist program that engages classrooms worldwide. I think that the PI should have involved more detail-oriented plans to integrate underrepresented minorities into this project. For example, which community is going to be integrated into this program? How will these resources become available?

*Summary Statement*

This proposal is very well written, the experimental design is well planned, and the topic is novel to this field. Understanding how biofilms interact with benthic invertebrate settlement rate is crucial in determining the success or need for artificial reefs. Applying new techniques, like eDNA, to this type of research makes sense, and emphasises that eDNA and metabarcoding can be a useful tool for determining community compositions. Overall, I think the PI has showcased a novel idea that will fulfill a knowledge gap in the scientific community. The PI has demonstrated how these molecular techniques will be used to understand biofilm community dynamics and the function of artificial reefs.

*What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?*

The proposed study seeks to understand how biofilms on artificial reefs differ from natural reefs and is the first proposed study to use whole-community sampling in-situ to compare anthropogenic and natural surfaces and relate them to ecological succession. This study proposes to use a genomics approach to address the ecological question of differential succession between man-made and natural reefs. Thus, the research has the potential to advance knowledge in both ecology and genomics. The proposed methodology is original in using both traditional and genomics approaches to identify organisms in a community. This approach should increase the resolution to which the study understands diversity of the biofilm. The proposed research also has the potential to inform future studies using in-situ whole community sampling.
The research approach is clearly drafted. The proposal contains a lot of detail including controls and the order of sampling which makes it seems clearly well-reasoned and researched. The candidate seems well-qualified to carry out the proposed research due to the detail of the proposed activities.


*What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?*

The applicant proposes to recruit underrepresented minorities from broad backgrounds to generate interest in the field of marine science. The initiative to promote professional development in underrepresented minorities (URMs) is very well though-out and includes objectives to teach research and professional skills from open-source programming to grant-writing and resume-building. The proposal also states that URMs will be encouraged to lead outreach initiatives. While there is a strong emphasis on undergraduate mentorship, I would like to see more details on initiatives to share research with those outside of the university community as well.

*Summary Statement*

The research proposed in this study seems promising to increase knowledge both in community ecology and genomics. The novel methodology proposed will be useful to inform future studies involving in-situ whole- community sampling as well as future ecosystem management involving artificial reefs. The mentorship outcomes of this proposal are incredibly detailed, however in addition to the mentorship goals of this study, I would like to see some more detail on outreach initiatives involving the non-academic community. The research proposed is clearly well-thought-out and is very detailed. I give my support to this application, however,
