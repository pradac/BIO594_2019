## Population Structure and Connectivity of the Atlantic Ribbed Mussel and Community Involvement with Surveys of the Ribbed Mussel and Salt-Marsh Die-off
Principal Investigator: Maggie Schedl


### Panel Summary
#### Objective(s) of the proposal
This proposal will use genomic techniques to investigate population structure and connectivity of the Atlantic ribbed mussel across its native range and assess the role of ribbed mussels in marsh die-off within Rhode Island marshes.

#### Intellectual Merit:
_Strengths_:

This study will investigate the population composition of the Atlantic ribbed mussel, which will be useful for future research based on this system. Mussels will be collected from a large portion of the species range. This study will use double digest Restriction Sites Associated DNA sequencing to generate a SNP dataset. Population connectivity and migration will be investigated using ADMIXTURE and TreeMix.

_Weaknesses_:

There is a disconnect between the two aims of the study, as the population genomic data from Aim 1 does not relate to salt marsh die-off presented in Aim 2. It is important to connect the aims of the study to the overarching goal. Physiological capabilities of the Atlantic ribbed mussel are discussed in the background of the proposal, however, there is no mention of collecting environmental data, such as temperature or salinity, to learn about adaptive physiology across the species range. These mussels will be collected along the east coast from Florida to Maine, which covers a broad range of environmental conditions, so these should be considered in the study. The panel did not consider Aim 2 of the study to be transformative, as salt marsh die-off has been previously reported in Bertness et al. 2014. Additionally, it is not mentioned how the research team will determine the role of the ribbed mussel in the extent of marsh die-off after re-surveying the sites in Narragansett Bay.

#### Broader Impacts:
_Strengths_:

All data and annotated analyses will be publicly available via GitHub for full reproducibility of the research. The data will be used as a teaching dataset open to any person or institution as an exemplary population genomics study.  Aim 2 of the study will involve Rhode Island local communities that will help survey the marshes for die-off. This research will engage students, parents, and older members of the underrepresented communities in all aspects of the study. All involved members will be given credit in any publication that is produced.

_Weaknesses_:

The community involvement is very important, however, this will require a lot of effort to engage and delegate everyone. The research team will have to establish a thorough plan outlining the community’s involvement in each aspect of the study, as well as a tight schedule to keep the project on track. It would also be nice to know that the research team has established a connection with a local high school or specific minority group that will be involved in the study.

#### Panel Summary Statement
The study system has a great potential to understand how genetic variation correlates with geography and environmental variation. The author needs to incorporate environmental variation to increase the value of this research. Overall, the panel agreed that reproducibility section was a strong aspect of the study, while more detail needs to be included in the methodology and a stronger connection needs to be made between Aims 1 and 2.

The summary was read by/to the panel and the panel concurred that the summary accurately reflects the panel discussion.

*Intellectual Merit*

The proposal aims to understand salt marsh die-off by examining the interaction between Atlantic ribbed mussel, smooth cordgrass, and burrowing crabs while also determining the population structure of ribbed mussel population. These seem like disparate ideas but could be successful with local natural experiments and a large-scale collection of ecological and genomic data across the Atlantic Coast.

The background discussed the symbiotic relationship between cordgrass and ribbed mussel but left out the influence of the burrowing crab (mentioned in the overview). There was also a suggestion that a rare behavior (air-gaping) would be explored for its physiological capabilities using NGS techniques, but the NGS approach proposed (population genetics and ddRAD), would not be able to address that knowledge gap. Also, a quick look into the literature suggests that there have been ecological studies on the distribution and habitat of ribbed mussel in the lower Chesapeake Bay (Isdell et al. 2018) in partial response to anthropogenic disturbance. This study was not cited in the proposal but indicates that ribbed mussel, though not intentionally moved due to fisheries or farming, is still impacted by human development. There is no indication in the research approach that other habitat characteristics and metadata will be taken along the coast as individuals are being collected for tissue biopsies.

*Broader Impacts*

The project seeks to provide publicly available datasets and tutorials for sequence analysis, which will be very useful for students and courses interested in using NGS for more ecological studies. As we begin to utilize NGS in more natural systems, it will be critical, as the PI said, for ecologists to understand genomic techniques.

In addition, the project relies heavily on local community involvement for the design, generation of, and dissemination of research findings. While it is admirable that one of the two specific aims explicitly outlined involvement with the local community, it is highly concerning to me that a local community of interest has not been identified, which to me signifies no currently established relationship with an underserved minority community. There is also little structure defined in Aim 2 for how the PI will proceed to identify a community, establish a relationship and build community trust with them, then organize and maintain a community-led effort to understand their local salt marshes. I agree that local community members should feel a sense of ownership to their projects and be properly credited for their work, but without a concrete foundation (e.g., via proposed workshops, brainstorming sessions, assigning graduate students to oversee projects, etc), I am less confident that this aspect of the outlined proposal will be successful.

*Summary*

I rate this as a good proposal in a fundamental area of ecological research. While this proposal has good aims for understanding the mutualistic relationship between two foundational salt marsh species, I am concerned about the lack of preparation in identifying the central (and highly sensitive) component to the proposed research – the local community with which the researchers would be intimately involved with. This, in combination with the disconnect between the two aims (genomic and ecological) and lack of justification for using an NGS approach other than its relative novelty, does not make me confident that this project will be successful if funded. However, if the researcher was more familiar with the ecological system and the local community, I think this project would be able to have a lot of great outputs in terms of both research and outreach.

*What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?*

This proposal aims to describe the population structure and connectivity of the understudied Atlantic ribbed mussel, Geukensia demissa, as it may be an important species in preventing salt marsh degradation. The PI elucidates the mutualistic relationship between the Atlantic ribbed mussel and Spartina species to maintain salt marsh habitats. The Atlantic ribbed mussel has a large distribution range from New England to Florida, suggesting it can tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions. The two main aims of this proposal are: 1) to determine the population connectivity and structure of the Atlantic ribbed mussel across its entire distribution range through Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), and 2) to determine the role of Atlantic ribbed mussels in the status of New England salt marshes through community integrated surveys.

Overall, this proposal is good and adds a unique aspect of integrating underrepresented high school students into collecting data for the second aim of this study. However, aim 1 is missing some connections between analyzing population structure and connectivity, and the large dispersal range of this species. Some examples from other species or hypothesises for this specific study would have been beneficial in providing a clearer question for the reader. More background about the importance of high or low population structure and connectivity in relation to the maintenance of salt marsh habitats would have made this aim more structured and directed to a specific question.

*What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?*

The broader impacts of this study are to have all the complied data and analyses available on GitHub to facilitate teaching and research development. Additionally, the PI proposes a unique opportunity for underrepresented high school students to obtain hands on research experience through salt marsh surveys for Atlantic ribbed mussels. This objective is very intriguing; however I would like to see a more established plan about how this will be conducted.

*Summary Statement*

This proposal aims to determine the population structure and connectivity of the under studied Atlantic ribbed mussel, which is potentially a keystone species for salt marsh ecosystems. The PI provides a standard framework to analyze populations across its native range (Maine to Florida) using a ddRAD approach. This is interesting however the question this is answering needs to be more developed and directed to a specific hypothesis. In the overview, the PI mentions the potential for local adaptation, however linking these analyses and experimental design to prove local adaptation is lacking. I do appreciate the unique approach this PI uses to integrate underrepresented high school students into a portion of this study to facilitate larger data collection and introduce research to young aspiring scientists.

Rating:	Excellent


*What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?*

Ribbed mussels are prominent inhabitants of salt marshes and however, little is known about their role in salt marsh die-off. The proposed study seeks to study the population structure of ribbed mussels as a non-model organism and determine the bivalve’s role in salt marsh die-off. The proposed study has high potential to increase our understanding of this little-studied occupant of salt marshes and their ecological function. Should the mussel be implicated in mitigating salt-marsh die-off as hypothesized, information regarding mussel population structure would be necessary to support effective management of the species. Incorporating ecological, genomic, and conservation biology, the study proposes an inter-disciplinary approach that is necessary to understand the complex problem of salt-marsh die-off. Since little is known about the genomics of the Atlantic ribbed mussel, this study is promising in advancing scientific knowledge on the population dynamics of this ubiquitous salt-marsh species.

The methodology outlined in the proposal indicates that the work has been well-thought out. The use of ddRAD balances the depth and breadth of the study while minimizing cost. The genomic aspect study is based on a large amount of scientific literature, and resources for de novo genome assembly necessary to complete the study are mentioned, suggesting that adequate resources are available to complete this study. Based on the detail of the methodology described and the strong availability of relevant scientific literature, I feel strongly that this team is qualified to carry out the proposed activities.


*What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?*

The broader impacts of this proposed study are built into the research itself. I fully support the broader impacts initiatives of this proposal and rate them as excellent. The proposed project promotes teaching and reproducibility through scientific transparency and mentorship in underserved minority students. It also incorporates community engagement by involving high-schoolers, parents and older community members in the research. The involvement of underserved minority high schoolers and family members in all parts of the scientific process is well-stated. I particularly like that they plan on giving academic credit to the students involved.

*Summary Statement*

The study promises a multi-faceted approach that is necessary to understand the complex nature of salt marsh die-off. This information is necessary to improve management of the salt marsh ecosystem and prevent a wide-spread decline in its range on the East coast of the United States. The methodology proposed in this study is sound. As for broader impacts I think that this study addresses the need for community involvement in the scientific process and will successfully increase appreciation for the salt marsh ecosystem in Rhode Island. The broader impacts of the study also detail the applicant’s initiative for scientific transparency and its uses in teaching.  Overall, I give this proposal an excellent rating.
