#### Title: The adaptive potential of Southern Ocean phytoplankton
#### Principal Investigator: Ian Bishop

###### *Overview*

This proposal focused on the phenotypic diversity of diatoms, and how epigenetics may impact their adaptive potential. This type of analysis has never been done on eukaryotic photoautotrophs. They will use ddRAD-seq to analyze diversity, and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing to examine epigenetic variability. They hope that elucidating these pathways will shed light on the possibility of diatoms adapting to future climate change.

###### *Intellectual merit*

*Strengths*

A major strength of this proposal was that it fills a clear knowledge gap. Panelists agreed that looking at epigenetic dynamics in these populations is a novel and interesting idea. There is also a clear connection to climate change research, which has important implications for future conservation efforts. This project will also examine two different species, which will allow the researchers to examine ecological and evolutionary dynamics and make stronger conclusions. While no reference genome exists for the species in question, the researcher has clearly examined the problem and found a good solution through various RAD-seq methods.

*Weaknesses*

The main weakness the panelists identified was a lack of some key background information. First of all, it would be helpful to acknowledge the debate on whether or not phenotypic plasticity is actually adaptive or not, and to further explain the difference between phenotypic plasticity and adaptive potential. These concepts are mentioned in the proposal, but not explicitly discussed. In addition, it is possible that bsRAD-seq actually includes ddRAD-seq, therefore somewhat confusing the two aims. There also needs to be a clear normalization step between ddRAD and epiRAD. In the description of experimental methods, it would be helpful to fully describe the scale of the populations being studied, and explain how the researchers plan to effectively isolate the species they are targeting. In general, more background was needed for the epigenetics section, and some acronyms used throughout the proposal were never fully defined. The proposal would be stronger if the background information included details about epigenetics and explicitly stated the connection between epigenetic function/diversity and adaptive potential. Not every reviewer will know exactly how epigenetic changes can influence a phenotype.

###### *Broader Impacts*

*Strengths*

The panel thought there were some great ideas in the broader impacts section! Lab visits and internships sound like a great idea to educate the local community, especially young students, about “good microbes.” Public presentations involving hands-on learning and sample collecting will be an effective way to communicate scientific ideas to the public.

*Weaknesses*

In the broader impacts section the researchers could have been more specific about how this research will advance scientific knowledge of the whole ecosystem. One of the strengths of this proposal is that it has strong implications for future climate change research, and it would be nice if that were elaborated on more.

###### *Summary*
Overall the panelists felt this was a strong proposal, but could benefit from more background information.  By expanding the background, especially on the epigenetics portion of the project, the panelists felt that the research design would also be much clearer. The panelists also recommend that this project could be expanded to include sequencing of the diatoms, which could be accomplished with the samples already being collected. All in all, panelists felt that the researcher is asking interesting questions, pursuing novel research, and has strong methods with which to carry it out.
