*What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?*

This study is looking into environmental memory in two coral species. While the project is clearly well thought out, it still leaves some questions. I am curious to know why they chose the two coral species that they chose. I am also interested in knowing how big will the coral fragments be and how will size impact this study? How will this study replicate a pCO2 condition? Figures of the sample design would be very helpful in understanding the methods. Especially since there is more than one project in this work. I am also confused why this study is looking at Aiptasia instead of another coral such as Astrangia. While I understand that all are cnidarians, I am curious to know if changing organisms would have any affect?

*What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?*

Broader impacts of the proposed activity:

This study would examine the theory of environmental memory in corals and other invertebrates. The outreach plan is clearly well thought out and I like that you will be speaking at universities and field sites as well as educating the public. I would recommend on making a website/twitter/Instagram for your project. Take pictures of students and people working and of the corals and the work that your doing. Sometimes it can be hard to visualize. Plus, you can reach a wider audience While educating the academic community is crucial, there is a lot of merit in teaching the public.

*Summary Statement*

In Summary: I would fund this project. While there are some technicalities that I have questions about, the study is relatively thorough and includes creative methods to examine the biological theory of environmental memory in corals. It would be interesting to try another invertebrate aside from aiptasia, maybe nematostella? Both are cnidarians, easy to grow, well distributed, but nematostella has been frequently used with acidification and temperature work. It would be interesting to have both to see if you get similar results in both organisms.

*What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?*

The proposed research will characterize the coral holobiont’s environmental memory response to environmental change through the examination of physiological performance, (epi)genetics, and microbiome communities.
The study is split into 4 main aims that fall within 3 projects, spanning 3 years. Aim 1 focuses on the environmental memory by reduced reactions theory, which is broken down into 3 sub-aims. In order to test the validity of the theory, the research team will investigate patterns of change in DNA methylation, gene expression, and physiological performance in response to repeat stress exposures, which will expand upon research that has already been completed. From there, they will evaluate the extent to which seasonal variation in methylation influences the patterns of change. Finally, as an extension of the exposure experiments, they will measure the recovery window associated with environmental memory and the potential to lose acclimatization if stress is not encountered for an extended period of time.

For Aim 2, they will investigate the relationship between gene expression and methylation by identifying genes involved in the coral holobiont stress response and measuring methylation patterns of those genes in response to multivariate stressors over time. For Aim 3, they will assess the influence of microbiome and symbiont diversity on the holobiont physiological response to stress. Finally, for Aim 4, they will combine the results from the first 3 aims to assist in restoration practices and conservation efforts.
While there are a lot of components of this proposed research, they are connected to a larger goal of understanding environmental memory response to environmental change. The project plans are all well thought out and will expand on research that has previously been completed. Aim 1 would have been sufficient for the research proposal, but really it depends on what the proposal is being submitted for (GRFP vs. some other grant proposal). It is evident that the research team has the appropriate resources and training to complete all parts of the research successfully.

*What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?*

Broader impacts of the proposed activity: The lab team will engage in multiple outreach events both locally and globally. Local outreach includes school and community visits, seminars at universities, local aquariums, and communities. Global outreach includes partnership with The Ocean Agency and the International Coral Reef Society Student Chapter. Additionally, all data, code, results, methods, and analyses will be accessible to the public either through GitHub or infographics/videos.
It is clear that the research team has already been involved in outreach events through SkypeAScientist and seminar presentations, and has established partnerships with other coral-focused organizations. The research team will be successful in hosting future outreach events.
The broader impacts section could be strengthened by adding more information about how underrepresented undergraduates will be recruited for these projects. What aspects of the projects will they be trained in?

*Summary Statement*

In summary, I rate this proposal as excellent. The proposal is well written and the overall goal of the project is easily understood. The 3-year project plan is comprehensive and it is clear how each aim is accomplished by each project (adding the colored superscripts for the associated project was helpful). While this proposal is made up of 3 research projects, they are connected to a larger goal of understanding environmental memory response to environmental change. Additionally, the research team has already completed multiple outreach events, so they will be successful with future efforts. Expanding on recruitment and training of undergraduate students will help make the broader impacts section even stronger.

*What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?*

This project examines epigenetic effects on coral’s ability to acclimatize to increasing ocean temperatures. Specifically, the researchers propose that the corals have an “environmental memory,” and can become more resistant to future heat stress if they are exposed to moderate heat stress earlier. There are three major projects, all designed to answer a different part of the larger question. The first part will take place in Hawaii, and will use RADSeq and EpiRAD, as well as other physiological measurements, to analyze coral responses to ambient temperature stress. Part of this section of the project has already been carried out, and the researchers seem to have executed their plan effectively. The second part of the project takes place in Rhode Island, and tests the ability of corals to “remember” acclimatization, and the effects of seasonal changes on methylation. The third part will take place in Moorea, French Polynesia, and will identify mechanisms contributing to holobiont variation across multiple generations.

The researchers are building on previous work, and clearly understand the background of this subject well. The background section was extremely thorough, but dense at times. The proposal might benefit from incorporating more figures to illustrate important concepts and previous research. The figures that were included should be larger and have descriptive captions.

In the experimental design, it would helpful if researchers stated their experimental controls more clearly. Each section of the project is examining many different variables and interactions, so controls can get lost in the larger discussion. Also, since the proposal includes research in three such different locations, and on three different species, the proposal could benefit from a discussion of the validity of synthesizing those results.

All of the methods in this proposal were thorough and well explained, and the researchers have the necessary experience to carry them out.


*What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?*

The proposed research has clear implications for future conservation efforts, and will greatly advance our knowledge of DNA methylation in corals. This project is an asset to research-focused conservation.

The researchers also have broad experience in scientific communication and engaging with the public. Members of the team have been involved with The Ocean Agency and the International Coral Reef Society, and have participated in such programs as SkypeAScientist and Letters to a Scientist. They show a clear commitment to community engagement and education. This is also a female-led research team, and they are committed to increasing representation in STEM fields from underrepresented groups. It would be helpful to elaborate on the potential infographics and short films, as this was intriguing but not fully explained.


*Summary Statement*

Overall, this was a strong proposal. It is extremely scientifically rigorous, and asks novel questions that have clear implications for future conservation efforts. The researchers seem well qualified to execute this project. Most criticisms were largely cosmetic, the proposed research seems sound. I would recommend funding.
