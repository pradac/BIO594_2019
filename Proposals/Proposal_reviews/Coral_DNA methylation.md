## DNA Methylation in Corals
Principal Investigator: Wong, Kevin

# Panel Summary

**Overview**:   
This proposal discusses the potential for corals to acclimatize to increased thermal stress via epigenetic modifications like DNA methylation. To better understand the mechanism behind the regulation of DNA methylation, the author proposes to manipulate nutrient conditions that then could have downstream effects on the activity of DMNT, the enzyme that takes a methyl group from the molecule SAM to add to a cytosine in the DNA sequence. Since the production of SAM is ATP driven, and the supply of ATP depends on the health of mitochondria, the author predicts that changes in the mitochondria’s glucose supply will have downstream effects, through several metabolic cycles, on the potential for the cell to methylate regions of DNA. This change in methylation because of lack of nutrition supply to the cell, will then change the patterns of gene expression, and thus change physiological function or a phenotype of the organism. This change in phenotype or physiological function could either be beneficial or detrimental in an organism’s response to climate change. The author identifies several knowledge gaps regarding the field’s knowledge about how the environment can influence methylation patterns, an organism’s ability to acclimatize to future conditions, and the potential for transgenerational effects through inherited DNA methylation patterns. The two specific aims of this project are 1.) to investigate the influence of mitochondrial health and nutritional state on methylation patterns and 2.) evaluate if this change in methylation patterning can be inherited and thus suggest potential for transgenerational effects through epigenetics and acclimatization to predicted climate change stressors.

**Intellectual Merit**:  
The intellectual merit of this proposal is strong, and the experimental design is well thought out. The current knowledge gaps explicitly stated include understudied transgenerational effects in scleractinian corals and role of metabolism on epigenetic modifications. The panel was unclear about what has been looked at before and what hasn’t since what the author stated for novelty was a bit general. The proposal is well-written and very clear what the intentions of the author are, both scientifically and analytically. 

**Broader Impacts**:  
This proposal aims to use an open source platform for all data, scripts, and code related to this project. The author plans to organize outreach activities in Bermuda, and fund a student research position from the BIOS-Bermuda Program Internship. Activities in Rhode Island will include partnership with SWMS and recruit underrepresented groups to aid in sample processing and to provide research experience for early career scientists. The goal is to have all data and findings published in peer-reviewed journals and available for a wide audience.

**General comments**:  
Since the panel reviewing this proposal has a broad background and topic interests and the topics addressed in these projects are very specific to epigenetics, putting this kind of research into context was difficult. The proposal would have been stronger if the projects were repetitively brought back up to the bigger picture. For example, the panel was unclear on what “good” methylation or “bad” methylation was and in terms of climate change, what does these mean? The connection between nutrition to methylation to gene expression to phenotype to acclimatization could be made more explicit. Reminding the reader of this connection throughout the proposal would be a good idea. Or how a manipulated nutritional state would occur in nature? What does look like in real life? The author could talk about how this could be part of coral bleaching. 

The panel was also unclear about how the author was going to measure acclimation to determine that TGP and methylation were in fact connection to an acclimatory response. Not everyone on the panel was versed in coral reef studies, or even epigenetics so making this connection is crucial for getting people behind the research. 

Again, because of the diverse background, the panel was curious about the use of Astrangia when talking about climate change affecting tropical corals. Our guess what that Astrangia is a good model to get baseline knowledge that the author could then apply to Porites and the bigger picture, but this isn’t explicitly stated. 

Overall, this is a very strong proposal and should be recommended for funding.  The general consensus was that readers outside of this specific field would have trouble connecting the dots between the topics discussed in the proposal. The dots themselves were well explained, but the author could have discussed more about the connections themselves and how making those connections will lead to a bigger picture. 

The summary was read by the panel and the panel concurred that the summary accurately reflects the panel discussion.


**Raw notes from the panel**:  
Overview:
Coral may be able to acclimatize to higher temp w epigen modifications specifically DNA methylation
TGP versus WGP potential 
Internal mechanisms that cause phenotypic change through epigenetic change 
Mitochondria metabolism and versus metabolites
SAM and methionine cycle feeds into potential for methylation 
Both methylation patterns and metabolic functions and nutritional effects 
Novelty is linking epigenetics and mitochondrial function 
Merit is linking metabolic function and epigenetic 


Knowledge gap: not clear but maybe no one has looked at this before?

No discussion of measuring acclimatory response so how do you connect this to big picture?
What is a good and bad response? 
What is good or bad methylation?

Bring back up to big picture and putting it into context is lacking 

Broader impacts:
Data and presentation at conferences and in Bermuda 
More in Rhode Island 

Why Astrangia and porites? Because they are different species 

Need a lot more on transgenerational 

Way more explicit on why aims relate to each other 
Could cut metabolic explanation 

Because it is so detailed you have to bring it back up to putting it into context and continue to justify why a study so detailed is crucial and timely now 

Unclear about using Astrangia for tropical coral reefs – temperate versus tropical
Why not using porites for both?

Talk more about how to explicit say the methylation between adult and juvenile 

Reviewers could poke holes in the transgenerational aspect – saying it might not happen in porites because if gametes are being formed while parent is exposing then is that transgenerational?

### Reviewer 1

*What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?*

This project focuses on the role of epigenetics, specifically DNA methylation, on the ability of stony corals to rapidly acclimatize to thermal stress. The researchers are examining both within generational plasticity (WGP), and trans generational plasticity (TGP). The goals of the project were specific, focused, and well-stated throughout the proposal. This is a transgenerational study, and therefore allows the researchers to draw new conclusions about the possible future of coral acclimatization to climate change.

The researchers did a good job outlining the new questions they will be answering, especially the epigenetic relationships that have been understudied in scleractinian corals. And while their questions are new, their methods for examining DNA methylation are well understood (although additional support for the efficacy of those methods could be helpful). The researchers had clear plans for their research, and seemed to have sufficient background in the field of study to perform their experiments well. The graphic explaining the experimental design of Aim 2 was especially effective, and demonstrated how they are doing a true transgenerational study.

One possible gap in the proposal was a lack of background information about the two different coral species being studied. While Astrangia poculata and Porites astreoides are both stony corals, they are in two different families and are being studied in two very different environments. Also, the A. poculata research takes place entirely in closed, experimental systems, while the P. astreoides experiments are partially in the field. It was unclear if these differences would have a significant effect on the application of the results. Since the results from both halves of the project are being used together to form larger conclusions, a discussion of why this valid would be helpful. It is true that both species will be exposed to similar stressors, so that remains consistent. It may be that these differences are not a problem, but it wasn’t addressed in the proposal.


*What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?*

The researchers have a clear plan to make their data widely available, and their analysis reproducible. They exhibit a familiarity with bioinformatics and in communicating their findings. This is important as their methods could be more widely applied to other stony coral species.

There are also many opportunities for outreach and education as part of this project. The researchers are familiar with the BIOS research station, and have previous experience with the internship program there. The program will involve local Bermudians in research and education. At URI, the researchers will collaborate with the Society for Women in Marine Science (SWMS) on some of their outreach and education programs. While there were specific activities proposed their time at BIOS (such as the camp run through the SPCA), there were fewer concrete ideas for their time at URI. However, since they are collaborating with an already established group, there will hopefully be multiple opportunities for outreach.

A major strength is that their outreach and collaborations will reach both the local community, and groups underrepresented in STEM fields.

This project also focuses on the effects of climate change, which is a major issue impacting many species other than corals. There is a clear application of the methods to other systems, and a clear application to global conservation efforts.


*Summary Statement*

Overall, this was a strong proposal, and the researchers seem well prepared to carry out the project. There are clear implications for both research and conservation, and are asking new questions about an important ecosystem. This project has sufficient support, planning, and advances the field. I recommend funding.



### Reviewer 2
Rating: Very Good

This proposal aims to determine the relationship between metabolic function and epigenomic patterning and explain how they interact to help shape trans-generational plasticity. Two experiments, using two different coral species from different North Atlantic localities, are clearly stated and are well thought out. For the first aim, it is clear what the author hypothesizes and that the proposed treatments will determine how nutrition might drive patterns in physiological measures that correspond to a hypothesized TGP pathway. While the metabolic traits to be measured make sense, it’s a little unclear whether bulk potential or site-specific changes in methylation would better test this hypothesis. The second aim in this regard is clearer, noting particular transcriptomic and epigenomic methods to be used.

One possible issue with this proposal is that the knowledge gap that would prompt such well-designed experimental work is not exactly clear. The plausibility of the proposed work is laid out effectively in the background section, where a strong case is made that metabolic activity and nutrition availability have the potential to influence epigenetic markers and phenotype plasticity more broadly. But the extent to which these connections have been researched previously and the expected relative importance of this putative pathway to changes in plasticity are unclear. These omissions make an evaluation of the novelty and impact of this research difficult.

After reading this proposal, I have several questions about the justification or rationale for the use of each study system. Are these coral species closely related? Are they representative of broader coral communities (particularly the temperate collections Astrangia poculata)? Given that each experiment uses a different species, how will findings from each aim support each other to further understanding of nutritional impacts on methylation? And finally, what is the current availability of transcriptomic and epigenomic resources available to support your analyses? For example, if they are not robust, does your proposed analysis support de novo assessment? If this is irrelevant, that was hard to determine in the proposal itself.
I believe the proposed research topic and specific aims are interesting and well-considered. The rationale for the research is clear, but its novelty is not explicitly stated. I would accept this proposal pending elaboration on its novelty and the study systems they propose to use, as explained above.


### Reviewer 3

*What is the intellectual merit of the proposed study?*

The goals of the proposal are to combine metabolomic and epigenomic approaches to elucidate the potential for acclimatization of corals to impending stressors, such as increased temperature.

The big strength of this proposed study is the emphasis on the interconnection of processes within an organism, understanding why a phenomenon like DNA methylation happens is to understand the metabolic background that allows it to happen. Additionally, the role of nutrition feeding into the metabolic processes is an important area to study. Importantly, this study proposes to address the next steps in understanding coral physiology and phenotypic trajectory as reefs continue to decline world-wide.

The interactions of enzymes, substrates, metabolites, and other molecules inside a cell that are necessary for DNA methylation need to be considered as complementary to studies that are focused on epigenetic differences. Following the chain back through the SAM cycle, other enzymes, and potentially molecules like folate, can really help elucidate why or how DNA methylation is happening. Methylation patterns in turn alter phenotypes, which may or may not lead to acclimatization.

It would be interesting to look at how DNA methylation may or may not affect the genes underlying the metabolic processes outlined on this proposal, such as components for the electron transport chain, the S-adenosylmethionine cycle, and the methionine cycle. In theory there could be a positive or negative feedback loop within that process.

While the two proposed experiments center around some of the same metabolic pathways and questions, how or if the results of one could potentially inform each other or be combined into a broader context is not stated in the proposal. If this is a limitation of using two different species, or measuring other differing metrics, is not clear. Additional information about when gametogenesis occurs in Porites astreoides is needed to understand the choice of the timing for the first temperature treatment.

The complexity of the transgenerational experiment is both exciting and daunting. It will be a challenge to tease out effects from parental fed/not fed treatment to larval effects of feeding, and with the added layer of temperature stress. There is the potential for not being able to find a causative effect because of all of the variables. However, multi-pronged approaches are necessary to understand phenomena such as temperature stress, because corals who experience high temperatures may also be limited or not on food, which would clearly affect their outcome from the stress event.

*What are the broader impacts of the proposed study?*

The author of the proposal sites their formative time leading a Bermuda summer camp focused on ocean studies. I think it is very important to engage with the local community where one is doing any field work, especially over-seas. The ability for a foreign researcher to use the ecosystem of another place is a great privilege, and so anything one can do to give back to the community is incredibly important. And I agree with the author, education at a young age fosters a lifetime of appreciation for natural resources and ecosystems.

Additionally, the commitment to providing all data in a reproducible fashion is something that should be necessary for all research, which the author does intend to do.

*Summary Statement*

There is a dire need to understand the mechanisms for coral reef acclimatization to climate change conditions. To keep an optimistic outlook, we must consider acclimatization as a short-term approach for corals to survive, and then investigate further to see if transgenerational affects may play a role.

The understanding of mechanisms behind plasticity in phenotypes and corals that survive bleaching or other stress event can help connect them back into their broader environment. Unfortunately, we know that temperature warming, caused by CO2 emissions is what is most effecting corals. But that is not something local governments or conservation groups can have much of an impact on. If a connection between coral acclimatization and nutrients or nutrition can be made, there is more potential for local management to still have a measurable positive effect on the coral community.

Overall this study proposed strong questions, and attempts to answer them in well thought-out, if complex, ways.
