## Selection across depths in Corals
Principal Investigator: Matias Gomez

## Panel summary

**Proposal Objectives**  
This proposal is concerned with assessing the strength of selection and adaptation to depth of the Caribbean reef forming coral species Orbicella faveolata using transects and reciprocal transplant experiments. The results of this investigation are to be used in informing the potential for use of deep water corals in restoration of shallow reefs.

**Intellectual Merit**  
_Strengths_  
The need to inform reef restoration practices is apparent, as reefs continue to decline globally, and especially in the Caribbean. Additionally, understanding the underlying genetic and potentially adaptive signatures of a wide-spread coral that does inhabit different reef habitats is important for understanding diverse reefs. If shallow and deep water Orbicella show vastly different genetic signals, there is a potential that a transplant of surviving deep water corals to degraded shallow reefs would not work. The choice of Orbicella is a logical one, where it is a species of concern, but present widely across the Caribbean, and there are existing genomic resources to bolster data analysis.

_Weaknesses_  
The main criticism is that the aims of the proposal seem to be posed to answer a question about local adaptation, and this is not related back to the broader goal of reef restoration. It also seems like the author is hypothesizing that the corals will be locally adapted, and therefore will not help restoration efforts, which seems to counter the larger goal. There has been a fair amount of research on the deep reef refugia hypothesis that generally says that it would be very site and species specific. There was also very little in the background or the methods about the proposed investigations in symbiont type, and that could actually be developed into a full aim. One thing to note is that it seemed like the proposal started as trying an interesting technique, and then the question and system to apply it to was thought of afterwards.

**Broader Impacts**  
_Strengths_  
The established connections with specific coral farms in the US Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico is a good strength for the proposal.

_Weaknesses_  
There was not very much in the broader impacts and that was something we all noticed. This section definetely needs to be expanded upon. More effort should be put into involving the RI community or the communities around where the study sites are in the research or in reef-restoration efforts.

**Summary**  
Overall, this was a good  proposal and the panel thought it was clear that the author had a good understanding of genomic techniques. The main thing that could be improved upon was tying in the aims to the methods better, to be clear about how the data and analysis will feed back into the aims.

*What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?*

The proposed research will estimate the role of natural selection acting on coral populations of Orbicella faveolata at different depths. They will do so by estimating survivorship rates in the wild and analyzing patterns of genomic variation in the coral host and its dinoflagellate symbiont.
This study is split into two aims. The first aim will focus on quantifying the strength of selection at the genetic level in natural populations using a reciprocal transplant experiment and establishing the identity and stability of dinoflagellate symbiont associations. They will search for signatures of natural selection using genome scans across four depth-segregated replicated populations. Then they will link symbiont variation to adaptation to depth in the coral species. From there, they will calculate allele frequencies before and after transplantation and estimate the strength of selection at two of the four sampling locations. To identify regions of the genome under selection, they will use Outflank, Bayescan, pcadapt, and an FST sliding window approach.
Aim 1 could be broken up into two separate aims, as it currently contains a lot of information. There is a lot of detail about the genome scans and the transplant experiments, but the part about symbiont associations is very briefly mentioned. The first aim should focus on the reciprocal transplant experiments used to quantify the strength of selection. The section on the dinoflagellate symbiont associations can then act as a separate aim. This way, more details can be added about the reasoning and methods for establishing the identity and stability of these associations.
Aim 2 will focus on inferring strength of selection from allelic clines across depth. They will genotype individuals across six depth strata across two of the four sampling locations to estimate allele frequencies. They will then sample individuals across a transect from shallow to deep in the same sampling locations in order to construct clines for each locus. To identify loci with sharp clines they will use a Bayesian genomic cline approach, binomial logistic regression, and will then fit their allele frequency data using a Metropolis-Hasting algorithm.

*What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?*

Broader impacts of the proposed activity: This research will add to the ongoing effort of coral reef restoration. They will continue to develop genomic resources, which will be made available to the public.
In addition to these larger impacts, it would be useful to include outreach events that you and your lab team will host to increase public understanding of coral reef restoration. What can you do in your local community to raise awareness? Are there any coral reef restoration groups in Rhode Island or New England that you can collaborate with? Adding a local outreach section would enhance the broader impacts of the proposed research.

*Summary Statement*

In summary, I rate this proposal as very good. It has the potential to advance understanding and improve restoration efforts of coral reef populations. Results of this study can help decide if it is plausible to use deep sea corals to repopulate diminishing coral populations. To further improve this proposal, Aim 1 can be split into two separate aims, so that more detail can be added to the symbiont associations section. Additionally, the broader impacts can be expanded upon by including a section that describes how the lab team will engage the local community in outreach events.


## Reviewer 2
*What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?*

The proposed study aims to further knowledge regarding adaptation to depth in corals by performing a transplant experiment to track survivability and sample for molecular analysis. A suggested practice in coral restoration work is the idea that deeper reefs can repopulate shallower reefs, but the effectiveness of this concept is not well studied. This project aims to assess the strength of selection different populations of Orbicella faveolata and to connect putatively adaptive alleles to survivorship of coral fragments. This project aims to integrate coral restoration work with modern genomic methods to predict survival potential for transplanted reefs.

*What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?*

This project aims to use the knowledge gained to further coral restoration efforts across the Caribbean and to expand the use of studies about potential for adaptation to conservation genomics. This research team has contributed genomic tools and provided a reference genome for this species already.

*Summary Statement*

I had trouble following the conservation angle with adaptation to depth because the author makes a case for tying the results to conservation efforts but thoroughly explains how corals are adapted to certain depths and aren’t able to survival when transplanted to other locations. Being clearer about the connection between investigating adaptation to depth and conservation will make this proposal stronger. How exactly does looking at strength of selection help guide restoration? Based on how the proposal is written, it feels like the research team will find that corals are very adapted to depth which contradicts the conservation efforts discussed at the beginning. I have an idea and can speculate but most reviewers won’t be versed in coral restoration methods or have experience adaptation background so even though it feels repetitive and a bit awkward, as a writer you have to hold the hand of the reader a bit, so they don’t need to speculate or guess what things mean. The author goes in depth on analyses methods but doesn’t expand much on experimental design. Analyses could be summarized to leave room for more details about the experiment. The use of jargon and specific details causes the reader to lose focus on the big picture, making it harder to follow along with the author’s train of thought. Any reader or reviewer is likely to not have as much background as the author or someone in the field. The way this proposal is written requires the reader to have extensive background knowledge to be able to make the same connections as the author. Having a summary sentence at the end of each paragraph that explicitly states how that information relates back to the big picture and existing knowledge gaps will strength this proposal. One thing that has always helped me think about writing is that your reader should never have to re-read your sentence or back track in the proposal to remind themselves of concepts or why you’re looking at certain things.


### Reviewer 3
Rating: Very Good

This proposal aims to interrogate the strength of selection/ecological filtering across coral habitat depth gradients using a combination of transplantation and gradient sampling in four representative Caribbean localities. Transplantation will test the strength of ecological filtering by measuring changes to putatively adaptive allele frequency over time in the transplanted population. The second aim will similarly identify putatively adaptive regions and map allele frequency change against depth, not just for shallow and deep communities but across a more highly resolved depth gradient, with six tested depths. These two approaches should in tandem reveal particular genomic regions under selection and how intense that selection is.

In the first aim, it is proposed that genomic markers in Symbiodinium symbionts will also be examined, but it is unclear to what degree and for what purpose. In Bongaerts et al. 2013 it was shown that in at least one coral species different symbiont populations varied with depth, but it is unclear how you intend to examine the effects of this potential confounding co-evolution, or if you even predict this relationship to exist. More rationale would be helpful for how depth adaptation in symbionts may contribute to your goal of assessing selection strength.

The proposal seeks to apply several well-considered methods for differentiating adaptive loci from neutral loci for this study. Given recent criticism about overzealous identification of adaptive genomic signatures, this conservative approach, which is analytically redundant, is convincing. However, a small point of confusion. While the sliding window approach the author suggests for identifying adaptive signatures is sound, no rationale is given for their assumption that such signatures will be spread out as opposed to concentrated. It may not effect end results, but the assertion is unsupported.

Lastly, it is somewhat unclear what is and isn’t already known about the strength of selection in these depth-structured populations. In the background section it is noted that there is already considerable evidence of genetic distance between deep and shallow coral populations, but it is never clearly stated what knowledge currently exists in terms of depth-associated adaptive divergence. Pointing out your knowledge gap more explicitly would help your case.

Overall, I rate this proposal very good. The broader goals of coral reef conservation and restoration would seem to be well-served by the proposed research. If depth-adapted corals are to be used in an assisted-migration context to save at-risk shallow coral reef habitat, the assessment of the viability of this effort must include the study of how strongly segregated these populations are and what role local adaptation plays in the survival of transplants. The proposed aims if successfully implemented would capably answer these questions using an appropriate, geographically relevant, well-studied coral species.
