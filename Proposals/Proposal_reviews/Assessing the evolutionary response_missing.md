## Assessing the evolutionary response of oyster larvae to multiple anthropogenic stressors: a mechanistic approach
Principal Investigator: Amy Zyck


### Panel summary

*Objective(s) of the proposal*

The objective of this proposal was to understand the synergistic effects of coastal acidification (CA) and low dissolved oxygen (LDO) on the larval physiology and survivorship of the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica (Aim 1). Additionally, this proposal aims to determine the genes that are involved in the response to CA and LDO (Aim 2), and if these candidate genes can provide insight on resistant genotypes (Aim 3).

*Intellectual Merit:*

**Strengths:**   	

This proposal identified a unique knowledge gap by using a multi-stressor approach to achieve more ecologically relevant stress responses in the larval developmental stages of C. virginica. The PI uses a good experimental design to achieve aims 1 and 2 by exposing a brood stock of laboratory fertilized larvae to CA, LDO, CA and LDO, and ambient conditions. By using a genotype to phenotype approach, the review panel agrees that this research is crucial in understanding the impacts of multi-stressor events on the early life stages of coastal marine invertebrates.

**Weaknesses:**

Although this research is novel, the panel identified disconnections between Aim 3 and the proposed experimental design. The experimental design outline for this proposal has no control for genotype. Mass spawning the collective parental oysters will make identifying larval genotypes difficult. Therefore, either the PI needs to be clearer about how they will control for genotype, or a modified version of the experimental design needs to be executed to achieve Aim 3. Additionally, the panel suggested that the proposed number of adult individuals may be too small to have enough genetic diversity to identify the candidate resistant loci.

The PI needs to clarify “resistant” genes and potential pathways that fall into this category. Since the main idea of this proposal is to identify the most resistant genotypes to CA and DO, the PI needs to define what a resistant phenotype is in this scenario and what potential genes could be involved.

The proposal is well written; however, the order of the background section should be structured to streamline the information to the reader. For example, the proposal should start with the importance of oysters to local communities, then transition into how CA and LDO can impact coastal marine invertebrates. Then the PI can introduce multi-stressor events and what the main objectives of this study are. The proposal would be stronger if background information on the genomics were well explained. For example, citing studies that suggest genotype is important for phenotypic change, and other studies that have looked at genotypic differences in oysters or any bivalve. The author could discuss why identifying putatively adaptive alleles is critical for understanding stress response. Citing other studies will help the author platform off these studies to introduce a genomic analysis novelty instead of just a multi-stressor novelty. The author could also talk about other studies that use genomic information to shape effective management. The background information section should cover all topics discussed in the proposal.

*Broader Impacts:*

**Strengths:**

The broader impacts of this proposal were strong, as the PI describes ways to make these datasets publicly available on open source platforms and in a reproducible format. Additionally, early career scientists will be integrated into the project to gain valuable research experiences. The main strength of the broader impacts of this proposal is the integration of data to fishery managers, as this type of research will enhance the understanding of local stressors on an important fishery species.

**Weaknesses:**

The main weakness of the broader impacts of this proposal were the details linking the expected results to fishery managers and conservation efforts. Having a more complete and detailed plan of connecting the results to management practices would enhance the importance of this research.

*Panel Summary Statement*

Over all, this proposal was well written and explored an important area of research where current knowledge is lacking. The panel concluded that this proposal would be ranked between the “good” and “very good” range.





### Reviewer 1

*What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?*

The proposed research aims to use a multi-stressor experimental design to further elucidate the physiology and genomic responses of the eastern oyster, C. virginica, to predicted future coastal acidification and low dissolved oxygen conditions. This project will be one of the few studies to integrate multiple stressors to simulate more realistic environment conditions while investigating the mechanisms that underlie stress response. Physiological response variables include shell morphology, growth, larval mortality, and respiration. Genomic response variables include identifying differences in allele frequencies at identified target loci and genes involved in the stress response. The findings of this study will further knowledge regarding potential for adaptation and lessen the knowledge gap between the pathway from genotype to phenotype. The research team plans to use recent and powerful bioinformatic tools to evaluate the individual organism’s stress response and thus make predictions about populations. This kind of research is at the fore front of conservation genomics and will guide effective restoration efforts as well as aquaculture management.

*What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?*

All data and analysis methods will be available for use to foster open science and communication between not only researchers with each other, but the general public as well. This project plans to support early career scientists and provide training for RI NSF EPSCoR participants. Outreach will include programs like Skype a Scientists, Save the Bay Foundation, and Coastal and Classroom Programs. The data and conclusions made from this project will enhance the long-term efficacy of current aquaculture practices and inform efforts in restoration and shellfish hatcheries. This project is clearly driven by the need for environmental conservation as well as further understanding the mechanisms of evolution.

*Summary Statement:*

This proposal is well written, and the experimental design is well thought out. Most of my comments are regarding sentence structure and lay out of the information presented in the proposal. The author doesn’t mention anything about the intellectual merit of the research team, which would help sell the reader on not only the project, but the people being funded. I’m not confident Aim 3 will be able to be addressed with the current experimental design. In the current design, genotype is not controlled but Aim 3 plans to address specific genotypes that will be best for survival. To do this, the author will have to track genotype and make sure there are enough of each genotype in each treatment to accurately say which genotype is the best fit for each kind of condition. Expansion on the bioinformatics and genomic methods in the experimental design and background sections is needed. For example - including examples of other studies that were successful in conservation genomics that looked at allele frequencies. It is unclear how differences in allele frequencies will directly identify genotypes that offer higher survivability. More details or additions to experimental design is needed.



### Reviewer 2
Rating: very good


*What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?*

This proposal seeks to test concurrent effects of coastal acidification and low dissolved oxygen on early stages of the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) from a physiological, morphological and genomic perspective. By adopting a multidimensional approach to understand the combined effects of two major stressor on marine organisms, the author wants to provide a testable framework in which organismal responses are directly linked to genomic background and its physiological responses. While climate change studies have focused on the increase of acidification or temperature, the additive or synergistic effect of them with localized impacts, such as local acidification and hypoxia caused by eutrophication, remains largely overlooked on coastal ecosystems. Moreover, the assessment of local impacts on intertidal setting tends to concentrate on already well established and mature communities or populations but leaving aside the first stages of larval development and settlement that ultimately give rise to such biological assemblages. Overall, the outcomes of the proposed research are bound to shed light on the mechanisms that allow species to deal with stressor and potentiate future adaptation to increasingly deteriorated marine conditions within a scenario of climate change.

*What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?*

A major emphasis is made on the use of open source programs and its public accessibility to facilitate and encourage reproducibility of the researched conducted, as well as publishing the results in an open-access format. Another strong component of the proposal rests on the training of undergraduate students in all aspects of the project.
The researchers also aim to generate valuable knowledge for the fisheries managers,
restoration organizations, and shellfish hatcheries (both for aquaculture and restoration practices) across most of the Atlantic coast of the US. Close collaboration with a local a non-profit organization intends to gain active involvement with the Bay community to develop education initiatives, policy reform, and restoration efforts.




*Summary Statement*

Overall, I rate this proposal as a very good one with well-define aims and a feasible experimental design that will permit the researchers to advance science on organismal adaptation to pH and oxygen interactions that will dominate most coastal environments in the coming decades.  Although the experimental designed was clearly laid out, I would like to call the authors` attention on some  genomic aspects that were either left out for lack of space or were not originally considered by them. Given the small number of individuals used as parental, what do the authors think about them being representative of natural genetic variability and the effect this could have in detecting relevant adaptive loci ? On the same note, do authors think that obtaining genome-wide data from the parental could be of any use, at least as means to estimating the original genetic diversity and allele frequencies of these individuals? Finally, I would like the author to address how to get around possible problems arising from using pooled data, such as samples with different abundances or difficulties in scoring the minor allele frequency, that may obscure the phenotype-genotype associations.


### Reviewer 3
Rating: Very good

*What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?*

This study is one of few that actually examine the impacts of coastal acidification and low DO separately and together. This study also has the oysters starting as larvae in these different conditions which is a great way of determining how these conditions affect oysters at their different life stages. A couple things that would be interesting: 1) to cross breed the surviving oysters within each treatment and repeat the study to see if there is any adaption that is passed along to the offspring, 2) examining more than one oyster species (to see if this could be applied globally).

*What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?*

Broader impacts of the proposed activity:
This study clearly has a lot of direct implications especially for aquaculture in the Northeast. They also tie in ways to be involved with currently well-established programs such as save the bay and are reaching out to the younger generation as well.

*Summary Statement*

In Summary: I would fund this study. This work clearly has important implications, not just for science, but also has a direct implication for aquaculture and oyster reef health as well as have future implications for other bivalves. One could extend this study to include other oyster species to see if the results are shared across species and if there is one particular species more suited for the conditions being tested.
