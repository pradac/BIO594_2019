### Overview

The panel will evaluate ~10 proposals. We follow NSF BIO-OCE procedure.

-	Each proposal discussed at panel will have 4 assigned panelists: 1 Primary, 1 Scribe, and 2 Readers.

*Primary panelists* read the proposal, write a review, and help evaluate whether the proposal should be discussed at panel. At panel, primary panelists lead the discussion and help with the panel summary.

*Scribe panelists* read the proposal thoroughly and help evaluate whether the proposal should be discussed at panel. You are encouraged to write a review, but this is entirely optional. At panel, scribes contribute to the discussion and lead the writing of the panel summary.

*Readers* are responsible for reading the proposal and reviews thoroughly before the panel meets. At panel, readers contribute to the panel discussion and help with the panel summary.
o	At the end of each proposal discussion, all 4 assigned panelists will individually rate the proposal.

We do not expect panelists to be equally familiar with all proposal topics. Primary and Scribe assignments will
generally be closer to your expertise than Reader assignments. In cases where assignments are not a perfect match
with your expertise, your input will be valuable in a broader context and you may have additional insights on the
reviews.

You do not have any reviewing responsibilities for proposals that are not assigned to you in one of the above three
categories. However, you may elect to participate in the panel discussion for any proposal for which you are not in
conflict.


Review Writing Tips
-	It is not necessary to summarize the proposal.

-	Provide an informative narrative that addresses both NSF Merit Review Criteria: Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts. Detailed instructions on the review criteria are available here:
https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/

-	Rate the proposal. Your evaluation should clearly support your chosen rating, especially in the case of ratings of
Excellent and Poor.
-	Be aware of and avoid implicit biases (gender, ethnic, racial, professional, personal).
-	Submit reviews in FastLane using the Panel Review System.

Proposal discussion process (20 minutes of discussion time is scheduled for each proposal)
1. CP introduces the proposal.
2. The Primary panelist provides a brief overview of the proposal and reviews. Informative and efficient
delivery of comments keeps us on schedule. Please aim to complete this overview in six minutes or less.
-	Start with a short synopsis of objectives of the proposal.
-	Summarize the strengths and weaknesses of both the intellectual merit and broader impacts.
-	Summarize the main points from the ad hoc reviews; address wide spread ratings or outlier reviews.
-	Give your overall evaluation of the proposal.

3. Scribe and Readers comments should provide additional insights on the merit of the research and note any
other highlights from the reviews. This can include reinforcement of points already made, but not repeating
them in detail. Questions and discussion are appropriate, but remember to be efficient.

4. Any unassigned panelist interested in the proposal can comment or ask questions.

5. Before discussion concludes, the Scribe should ensure they have recorded the important points so they can
write the Panel Summary.

6. Each assigned panelist will provide a rating and then we move on to the next proposal.



### Discussion tips:
-	Each proposal must be evaluated on its own merit, therefore avoid comparisons with other proposals.
-	Consider whether the proposal is doable given finite resources.

Panel wrap up
-	A summary of the highest ranked proposals will be presented and discussed.
-	You will be asked to identify which proposals you consider transformative or high risk/high reward. More information on NSFâ€™s definition of transformative research is available here: https://www.nsf.gov/about/transformative_research
